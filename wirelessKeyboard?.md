# Wireless Keyboard?
The dream was simple, a normal split wireless keyboard: better posture, no wires, clean desk. How hard is that supposed to be.

Okay, yeah sure i had a checklist of things to make it perfect. But that's besides the point. The whole mechanical keyboard community should have a least solved this problem by now. But i guess now. So leave it to me to make some jank garbage, in attempt to create this "Dream Keyboard"

This is a build guide, but it's mostly my journey into the depths of the keyboard world.
